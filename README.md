# 🧠 AI-Powered Mental Health Prediction System

An AI-powered project that predicts mental health states from **audio**, **text**, or **image** inputs. The goal is to offer a multi-modal mental wellness assistant, with a future integration of a **Bhagavad Gita–based chatbot** to provide spiritual support and practical advice.

## 📌 Features

- 🎧 **Audio Input** – Voice emotion analysis using MFCC features
- 📝 **Text Input** – Sentiment and emotion detection from user-written content
- 🖼️ **Image Input** – Facial emotion recognition via deep learning
- 📜 **Gita Shloka Chatbot** *(Planned Feature)* – Will suggest Gita verses based on mental state

## 🧠 Mental Health Categories

- Depression  
- Anxiety  
- Stress  
- Calm  
- Happy  
- Sad  
- Neutral

## 🧪 Workflow

### 1. **Input Processing**
- **Audio**: MFCC extraction (via Librosa)
- **Text**: Sentiment analysis (via NLTK or spaCy)
- **Image**: CNN-based emotion detection (via OpenCV/Keras)

### 2. **Prediction**
- Independent ML/DL models for each modality
- Final output: predicted mental health state

### 3. **Gita Shloka Recommendation (Chatbot)** *(⚠️ Not Yet Implemented)*
- This is a planned feature for future development.
- Once complete, it will:
  - Match the detected mental health state to a curated Gita verse
  - Provide:
    - 📜 A meaningful shloka
    - 💬 Interpretation in simple language
    - 🧘 Practical advice inspired by ancient wisdom

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Libraries:** Librosa, OpenCV, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch, Scikit-learn
- **Frameworks (optional):** Streamlit or Flask for deployment
